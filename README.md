## About the Video Course
MATLAB is the language of choice for many researchers and mathematics experts for Machine Learning. This video course will help you build a foundation in Machine Learning using MATLAB. You’ll start by performing data fitting, pattern recognition, and clustering analysis. Then, you’ll explore feature selection and extraction techniques for dimensionality reduction for performance improvement. Finally, you will learn to put it all together through real-world cases covering major Machine Learning algorithms and will now be an expert in performing Machine Learning with MATLAB.
